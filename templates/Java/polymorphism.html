    <h1>Java Polymorphism</h1>

          Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. <br />
          Like we specified in the previous chapter;<a href="inheritence.html">Inheritence</a> lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways. <br>
          For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):
          <br />Example:
        </p>
        <img src="\static\images\JavaImage\poly1.png" alt="" width="1200px"/>
        <p>
          Now we can create Pig and Dog objects and call the animalSound() method on both of them: <br>
          Example:
        </p>
        <img src="\static\images\JavaImage\poly2.png" alt="" width="1200px"/>
      </div>
    </div>
